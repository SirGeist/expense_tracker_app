# Tutorial Expense Tracker Application for Learning Flutter & Dart

## Description
The tutorial consisted of learning and applying various flutter concepts such as
getting user input and storing it, adding an appbar with titles and actions, adding
a modal with a snack bar, creating and deleting cards, and more. By following the
lectures, I created an application where a user can track what items they have bought.
Users can quickly create and remove these expenses and a bar graph will display the
expense type and its total quantity.

- Flutter SDK Used: '>=3.0.5<4.0.0'
